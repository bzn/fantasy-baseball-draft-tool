# Data Directory

This directory stores user-generated CSV files from importing league data.

## Files Created During Usage

- `hitters.csv` - Batter projections from FanGraphs Fantasy Dashboard
- `pitchers.csv` - Pitcher projections from FanGraphs Fantasy Dashboard
- `positions.csv` - Yahoo Fantasy position eligibility data
- `merged.csv` - Combined player data (FanGraphs + Yahoo)

## Important Notes

⚠️ **These CSV files are NOT tracked by Git** - they contain your personal league data and are unique to each user.

The directory structure is preserved in the repository, but you'll need to import your own data after cloning the project.

## How to Generate Data

1. Go to **Projections** tab → Import FanGraphs Fantasy Dashboard data
2. Go to **Yahoo** tab → Import Yahoo Fantasy position data
3. Click **Merge** to generate `merged.csv`

See the main README.md for detailed instructions.
